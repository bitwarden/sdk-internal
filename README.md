# Bitwarden Internal SDK

This repository houses the internal Bitwarden SDKs. We also provide a public
[Secrets Manager SDK](https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk-sm).

### Disclaimer

The password manager SDK is not intended for public use and is not supported by Bitwarden at this
stage. It is solely intended to centralize the business logic and to provide a single source of
truth for the internal applications. As the SDK evolves into a more stable and feature complete
state we will re-evaluate the possibility of publishing stable bindings for the public. **The
password manager interface is unstable and will change without warning.**

## Getting Started

### Linux / Mac / Windows

```bash
cargo build
```

### Windows on ARM

To build, you will need the following in your PATH:

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
  - We recommend installing this via the
    [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)

## Documentation

Please refer to our [Contributing Docs](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/) for
[getting started](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/getting-started/sdk/) instructions and
[architectural documentation](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/sdk/).

You can also browse the latest published documentation:

- [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/bitwarden/latest/bitwarden/) for the public SDK.
- Or for developers of the SDK, view the internal
  [API documentation](https://sdk-api-docs.bitwarden.com/bitwarden_core/index.html) which includes
  private items.

## Crates

The project is structured as a monorepo using cargo workspaces. Some of the more noteworthy crates
are:

- [`bitwarden-api-api`](./crates/bitwarden-api-api/): Auto-generated API bindings for the API
  server.
- [`bitwarden-api-identity`](./crates/bitwarden-api-identity/): Auto-generated API bindings for the
  Identity server.
- [`bitwarden-core`](./crates/bitwarden-core/): The core functionality consumed by the other crates.
- [`bitwarden-crypto`](./crates/bitwarden-crypto/): Crypto library.
- [`bitwarden-wasm-internal`](./crates/bitwarden-wasm-internal/): WASM bindings for the internal
  SDK.
- [`bitwarden-uniffi`](./crates/bitwarden-uniffi/): Mobile bindings for swift and kotlin using
  [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/).

## API Bindings

We autogenerate the server bindings using
[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator). To do this we first need to
build the internal swagger documentation.

### Swagger generation

The first step is to generate the swagger documents from the server repository.

```bash
# src/Api
dotnet swagger tofile --output ../../api.json ./bin/Debug/net8.0/Api.dll internal

# src/Identity
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=development dotnet swagger tofile --output ../../identity.json ./bin/Debug/net8.0/Identity.dll v1
```

### OpenApi Generator

To generate a new version of the bindings run the following script from the root of the SDK project.

```bash
./support/build-api.sh
```

This project uses customized templates which lives in the `support/openapi-templates` directory.
These templates resolves some outstanding issues we've experienced with the rust generator. But we
strive towards modifying the templates as little as possible to ease future upgrades.

Note: If you don't have the nightly toolchain installed, the `build-api.sh` script will install it
for you.

## Developer tools

This project recommends the use of certain developer tools, and also includes configurations for
them to make developers lives easier. The use of these tools is optional and they might require a
separate installation step.

The list of developer tools is:

- `Visual Studio Code`: We provide a recommended extension list which should show under the
  `Extensions` tab when opening this project with the editor. We also offer a few launch settings
  and tasks to build and run the SDK
- `bacon`: This is a CLI background code checker. We provide a configuration file with some of the
  most common tasks to run (`check`, `clippy`, `test`, `doc` - run `bacon -l` to see them all). This
  tool needs to be installed separately by running `cargo install bacon --locked`.
- `nexttest`: This is a new and faster test runner, capable of running tests in parallel and with a
  much nicer output compared to `cargo test`. This tool needs to be installed separately by running
  `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked`. It can be manually run using
  `cargo nextest run --all-features`

## Cargo fmt

We use certain unstable features for formatting which require the nightly version of cargo-fmt.

To install:

```
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```

To run:

```
cargo +nightly fmt
```
