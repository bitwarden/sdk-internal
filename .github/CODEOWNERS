# We have a few ownership models in use here, applied to team-owned crates as well as CLI code:
# 1. Full ownership by team-platform-dev, for cases where teams have not yet onboarded at all.
# 2. Joint team ownership with team-platform-dev, as a team onboards into SDK development and close guidance is necessary.
# 3. Joint team ownership with team-sdk-sme, once a team is comfortable with SDK development but still would benefit from architectural oversight.
# 4. Full team ownership, once a team is comfortable with SDK development and has enough shared experience to  ensure alignment with SDK architecture.

# Platform is the default owner for all files
