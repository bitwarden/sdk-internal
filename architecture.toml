description = """
The internal SDK is structured as a single Git repository with multiple internal crates. This
document describes the general structure of the project. Please review the individual `README`s in
the repository for information about the specific crates or implementation details.

We generally strive towards extracting features into separate crates to keep the `bitwarden-core`
crate as lean as possible. This has multiple benefits such as faster compile-time and clear ownership of features.
