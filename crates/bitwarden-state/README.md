# bitwarden-state

This crate contains the core state handling code of the Bitwarden SDK. Its primary feature is a
namespaced key-value store, accessible via the typed [Repository](crate::repository::Repository)
trait.

To make use of the `Repository` trait, the first thing to do is to ensure the data to be used with
it is registered to do so:

```rust
struct Cipher {
    // Cipher fields
};

// Register `Cipher` for use with a `Repository`.
// This should be done in the crate where `Cipher` is defined.
bitwarden_state::register_repository_item!(Cipher, "Cipher");
```

With the registration complete, the next important decision is to select where will the data be
stored:

- If the application using the SDK is responsible for storing the data, it must provide its own
  implementation of the `Repository` trait. We call this approach `Client-Managed State` or
  `Application-Managed State`. See the next section for details on how to implement this.

- If the SDK itself will handle data storage, we call that approach `SDK-Managed State`. The
  implementation of this is will a work in progress.

Note that these approaches aren't mutually exclusive: a repository item can use both client and SDK
managed state at the same time. However, this mixed approach is only recommended during migration
scenarios to avoid potential confusion.

## Client-Managed State

With `Client-Managed State` the application and SDK will both access the same data pool, which
simplifies the initial migration and development. Using this approach requires manual setup, as we
need to define some functions in `bitwarden-wasm-internal` and `bitwarden-uniffi` to allow the
applications to provide their `Repository` implementations. The implementations themselves will be
very simple as we provide macros that take care of the brunt of the work.

To add support for a new `Repository`, add it to the list defined at the end of
`crates/bitwarden-pm/src/migrations.rs`.

```rust
macro_rules! create_client_managed_repositories {
    ($container_name:ident, $macro:ident) => {
        $macro! {
            $container_name;
            // List any SDK-managed repositories here. The format is:
            // <fully qualified path to the item>, <item type idenfier>, <field name>, <name of the repository implementation>
            ::bitwarden_vault::Cipher, Cipher, cipher, CipherRepository;
            ::bitwarden_vault::Folder, Folder, folder, FolderRepository;
        }
    };
}
```

#### How to initialize Client-Managed State on the web clients

Once we have the function defined in `bitwarden-wasm-internal`, we can use it from the web clients.
For that, the first thing we need to do is create a mapper between the client and SDK types. This
mapper will also contain the `UserKeyDefinition` for the `StateProvider` API and should be created
in the folder of the team that owns the model:

```typescript
export class CipherRecordMapper implements SdkRecordMapper<CipherData, SdkCipher> {
  userKeyDefinition(): UserKeyDefinition<Record<string, CipherData>> {
    return ENCRYPTED_CIPHERS;
  }

  toSdk(value: CipherData): SdkCipher {
    return new Cipher(value).toSdkCipher();
  }

  fromSdk(value: SdkCipher): CipherData {
    throw new Error("Cipher.fromSdk is not implemented yet");
  }
}
```

Once that is done, we should be able to register the mapper in the
`libs/common/src/platform/services/sdk/client-managed-state.ts` file, inside the `initializeState`
function:

```typescript
export async function initializeState(
  userId: UserId,
  stateClient: StateClient,
  stateProvider: StateProvider,
): Promise<void> {
  stateClient.register_client_managed_repositories({
    cipher: new RepositoryRecord(userId, stateProvider, new CipherRecordMapper()),
  });
}
```

#### How to initialize Client-Managed State on iOS

Once we have the function defined in `bitwarden-uniffi`, we can use it from the iOS application:

```swift
class CipherStoreImpl: CipherStore {
    private var cipherDataStore: CipherDataStore
    private var userId: String

    init(cipherDataStore: CipherDataStore, userId: String) {
        self.cipherDataStore = cipherDataStore
        self.userId = userId
    }

    func get(id: String) async -> Cipher? {
        return try await cipherDataStore.fetchCipher(withId: id, userId: userId)
    }

    func list() async  -> [Cipher] {
        return try await cipherDataStore.fetchAllCiphers(userId: userId)
    }

    func set(id: String, value: Cipher) async { }

    func remove(id: String) async { }
}

let store = CipherStoreImpl(cipherDataStore: self.cipherDataStore, userId: userId);
try await self.clientService.platform().store().registerCipherStore(store: store);
```

### How to initialize Client-Managed State on Android

Once we have the function defined in `bitwarden-uniffi`, we can use it from the Android application:

```kotlin
val vaultDiskSource: VaultDiskSource ;

class CipherStoreImpl: CipherStore {
    override suspend fun get(id: String): Cipher? {
        return vaultDiskSource.getCiphers(userId).firstOrNull()
            .orEmpty().firstOrNull { it.id == id }?.toEncryptedSdkCipher()
    }

    override suspend fun list(): List<Cipher> {
        return vaultDiskSource.getCiphers(userId).firstOrNull()
            .orEmpty().map { it.toEncryptedSdkCipher() }
    }

    override suspend fun set(id: String, value: Cipher) {
        TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }

    override suspend fun remove(id: String) {
        TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }
}

getClient(userId = userId).platform().store().registerCipherStore(CipherStoreImpl());
```

## SDK-Managed State

With `SDK-Managed State`, the SDK will be exclusively responsible for the data storage. This means
that the clients don't need to make any changes themselves, as the implementation is internal to the
SDK. To add support for an SDK managed `Repository`, a new migration step needs to be added to the
`bitwarden-state-migrations` crate.

### How to initialize SDK-Managed State

Go to `crates/bitwarden-pm/src/migrations.rs` and add a line with your type, as shown below. In this
example we're registering `Cipher` and `Folder` as SDK managed.

```rust,ignore
/// Returns a list of all SDK-managed repository migrations.
pub fn get_sdk_managed_migrations() -> RepositoryMigrations {
    use RepositoryMigrationStep::*;
    RepositoryMigrations::new(vec![
        // Add any new migrations here. Note that order matters, and that removing a repository
        // requires a separate migration step using `Remove(...)`.
        Add(Cipher::data()),
        Add(Folder::data()),
    ])
}
```
