//! This module provides functionality to generate a cryptographic fingerprint for a public key.
//! This is based on a set of parts of a public key, for RSA this can be the modulus and exponent,
//! in canonical form.
//!
//! Currently, only SHA256 is supported, but the format is designed to be extensible, to more
//! algorithms in the future, should SHA256 ever not fulfill the required security properties.
