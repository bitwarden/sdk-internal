//!
//! This module contains all the necessary parts to create an in-memory key store that can be used
//! to securely store key and use them for encryption/decryption operations.
//!
//! ## Organization
//!
//! ### Key Identifiers
//! To avoid having to pass key materials over the crate boundaries, the key store API uses key
//! identifiers in its API. These key identifiers are user-defined types that contain no key
//! material, and are used to uniquely identify each key in the store. The key store doesn't specify
//! how these traits should be implemented, but we recommend using `enums`, and we provide an
//! optional macro ([key_ids](crate::key_ids)) that makes it easier to define them.
//!
//! ### Key Store
//! [KeyStore] is a thread-safe in-memory key store and the main entry point for using this module.
//! It provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt data using the keys stored in the store. The
//! store is designed to be used by a single user and should not be shared between users.
//!
//! ### Key Store Context
//! From a [KeyStore], you can also create an instance of [KeyStoreContext], which initializes a
//! temporary context-local key store for encryption/decryption operations that require the use of
//! per-item keys (like cipher keys or send keys, for example). Any keys stored in the context-local
//! store will be cleared when the context is dropped.
